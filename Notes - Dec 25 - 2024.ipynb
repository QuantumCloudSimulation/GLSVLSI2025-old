    "### Analysis of Current Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The current design is well-structured, with a clear separation of responsibilities among the components. Follwing is a breakdown of its strengths and potential areas for improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strengths**\n",
    "1. **Modularity:**\n",
    "   - Classes like `QCloud`, `Broker`, `QuantumDevice`, and `QJob` have distinct roles, which is essential for maintainability and extensibility.\n",
    "   - `SerialBroker` and `ParallelBroker` extend `Broker` effectively, showcasing a good use of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility:**\n",
    "   - The design allows for the addition of new quantum devices and brokers without modifying the core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Clear Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Each component handles its responsibilities (e.g., `QuantumDevice` for qubits, `Broker` for scheduling).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability:**\n",
    "   - The use of SimPy provides a good foundation for simulating concurrent events, enabling testing of various configurations and workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Areas for Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coupling Between Components:**\n",
    "   - `QCloud` tightly couples the job generation, broker initialization, and job scheduling logic. This could be refactored to improve separation of concerns. \n",
    "   - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Limited Abstraction for Devices:**\n",
    "   - Device-specific logic (e.g., maintenance, job processing) could benefit from further modularization to allow easier extension for non-IBM devices.\n",
    "   - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Lack of Asynchronous Job Management:**\n",
    "   - Currently, job handling appears to be synchronous at the device level. Introducing a more asynchronous or parallel approach could improve simulation fidelity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing and Validation:**\n",
    "   - There’s no indication of a robust testing strategy for individual components or their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **No Standardized Interfaces:**\n",
    "   - Abstract interfaces for devices, brokers, and job models would ensure adherence to a common contract, reducing errors when adding new components.\n",
    "   - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "   \n",
    "6. **Hardcoded Parameters:**\n",
    "   - Values like `random.expovariate(lambd=6)` or device-specific parameters are hardcoded, reducing flexibility and testability.\n",
    "   - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Proposed Redesign**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Layered Architecture**\n",
    "Structure the components into well-defined layers:\n",
    "- **API Layer:**\n",
    "  - Expose an interface for configuring and running the simulation (e.g., `QCloud`).\n",
    "  - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "- **Core Logic:**\n",
    "  - Handle quantum job scheduling, broker logic, and simulation control (e.g., `Broker`, `QJob`).\n",
    "- **Device Abstraction:**\n",
    "  - Provide a base class for quantum devices with methods for processing jobs, maintenance, and resource management.\n",
    "  - <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "- **Utility Functions:**\n",
    "  - Isolate shared functionality (e.g., graph manipulation, random generation) for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Abstract Interfaces for Components**    <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "Define abstract base classes for `Broker` and `QuantumDevice` to enforce consistency. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class QuantumDeviceInterface(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def process_job(self, job_id: int, qubits_required: int, wait_time_start: float):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def maintenance(self, maintenance_switch: bool):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for `Broker`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BrokerInterface(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Decouple Job Generation from `QCloud`**  <font color = red>This has been fixed 12-24-2024</font>\n",
    "Move the job generation logic out of `QCloud` into a separate component (e.g., `JobGenerator`). This keeps `QCloud` focused on managing the cloud infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Introduce an Event Queue**\n",
    "Replace the direct execution of brokers with an event queue. This would make the scheduling of jobs more explicit and allow for flexible policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Parameterization and Configuration**\n",
    "Use a configuration system (e.g., JSON or YAML) for specifying parameters like `maintenance_interval`, `job_generation_model`, or device-specific attributes. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "devices:\n",
    "  - type: IBM_guadalupe\n",
    "    maintenance_interval: 100\n",
    "    maintenance_duration: 15\n",
    "    clops: 1400\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Testing and Simulation Validation**\n",
    "Integrate a testing framework to validate components independently. For example:\n",
    "- Unit tests for `Broker` and `QuantumDevice`.\n",
    "- Simulation scenarios to verify the end-to-end flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to implement specific parts of this redesign or prepare an example refactored version of one of your components (e.g., `QCloud`, `Broker`)? Let me know how you’d like to proceed!"

    "### **7. Adding Listeners**\n",
    "You can now add listeners to log events or perform actions based on specific events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Listener**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def log_job_created(data):\n",
    "    print(f\"Job Created: {data['job_id']} at {data['timestamp']}\")\n",

    "env.event_bus.subscribe(\"device_start\", log_device_start)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of EventBus**\n",
    "1. **Decoupling**: Components communicate indirectly via events, reducing tight coupling.\n",
    "2. **Scalability**: Easily add new features or listeners without modifying core logic.\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**: Event-driven architecture supports monitoring, logging, and debugging.\n",
    "4. **Extensibility**: Future events (e.g., `device_failure`) can be easily integrated."
